# test if the last distance is less than the total distance, 
# an exception is thrown
#     ex: the last control point (120.00 km) must be at least 200 km

# test if the last distance is MORE than 20% of the total distance, 
# an exception is thrown
#     ex: the last control point (250.00 km) is over 20% longer than 
#         the theoretical distance (200 km): error in selecting units?

# test if the last distance less than OR equal to 20% more than the total distance, 
# no exception is thown, and calculation is based on total distance and not last distance
